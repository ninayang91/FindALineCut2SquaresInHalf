# FindALineCut2SquaresInHalf
Given two squares on a 2D plane, find a line segment that would cut these two squares in half.

Assume that the top and the bottom sides of the square run parallel to x-axis

The line segment returned should starts and ends at the edges of the squares

find the x direction and y direction

use slope>1,==1,<1 to check interact with edges
